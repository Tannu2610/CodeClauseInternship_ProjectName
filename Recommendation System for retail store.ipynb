How to cleanse - Although everyone is different and needs to listen to their body as they cleanse, Pressed’s juice plan recommends drinking 1 juice every 2 hours in the following recommended order: Greens with Ginger, Orange Turmeric, Roots with Ginger, Greens with Ginger, Sweet Citrus, Avocado Greens Smoothies. Drink the first one when you wake up in the morning, and try to drink the last one two hours before sleeping. Add one Wellness shot and one Vitality shot at any point of the day to boost your cleanse. Juice cleansing is intended to replace solid meals, though again everyone is different and should consume food, water and juice as they need. Be prepared for changes in your digestion and even sleep rhythms as your body adjusts to the cleanse, and make sure you stay hydrated with water throughout, as you might find shifting energy levels and mood in your first juice cleanse.   Green with Ginger - Made from the freshest, highest-quality green vegetables we can find, our green juice is a simple and easy addition to a healthy lifestyle.

Our Orange Turmeric elevates everyday OJ with a vibrant blend of orange juice, black pepper, and turmeric from Fiji.   Roots with Ginger - We've blended carrots and beets to create delicious juices for all taste buds-from earthy to sweet!

Wellness Shots\\nThese shots are lemony with a powerful kick from ginger and cayenne. Ginger's spicy goodness contains anti-inflammatory properties that help with circulation, aid in digestion by soothing the stomach and support glowing skin and circulation.

Orders placed after 12 pm PST on Tuesday will not ship until the following Monday.   Pressed is on a mission to make high nutrition a realistic option for all. Our cold-pressed juices are made with all-natural fruits and vegetables - no added sugars.   How to cleanse: Although everyone is different and needs to listen to their body as they cleanse, Pressed’s juice plan recommends drinking one 12oz juice every 2 hours in the following order: Avocado Greens Juice, Refreshing Citrus Juice, Roots with Ginger Juice, Greens with Ginger Juice, Sweet Citrus Juice, Strawberry Orange Mango Juice. Drink the first one when you wake up in the morning and try to drink the last one two hours before sleeping. Add one Wellness shot and one Vitality shot at any point of the day to boost your cleanse. Juice cleansing is intended to replace solid meals, though again everyone is different and should consume food, water and juice as they need. Be prepared for changes in your digestion and even sleep rhythms as your body adjusts to the cleanse, and make sure you stay hydrated with water throughout, as you might find shifting energy levels and mood in your first juice cleanse.   Avocado Greens Smoothie - Expertly blended and ready to go, this clean and simple recipe is packed with power greens like spinach, kale, and spirulina, mixed with banana, avocado, and matcha for a creamy-smooth taste.   Refreshing Citrus - Light, revitalizing and fresh, with just the right amount of sweetness. Pineapple and lemon are balanced with hydrating aloe vera water & coconut water to bring you 680mg of potassium, 15% of your daily value.   Roots with Ginger - We've blended ginger and beets to create delicious juices for all taste buds-from earthy to sweet! Grown deep in the ground, root vegetables absorb high amounts of vitamins and minerals from the soil. They have distinct, earthy flavors and are packed with fiber and complex carbohydrates.   Green with Ginger - Made from the freshest, highest-quality green vegetables we can find, our green juice is a simple and easy addition to a healthy lifestyle. Our green juice is perfectly blended, so you never have to compromise taste for nutrition.   Sweet Citrus - Our citrus blend is refreshing, hydrating and crisp. It contains ingredients like lemon and mint that provide a pick-me-up when you're feeling down.   Strawberry Orange Mango Smoothie: Skip the blender and go straight to refueling with our Strawberry Orange Mango Smoothie! The fruit-based smoothie is delightfully refreshing thanks to apple, orange, strawberry, mango, and peaches, while lemon, elderberry, and vitamin C boost your system from the inside out.   Wellness Shots\\nThese shots are lemony with a powerful kick from ginger and cayenne.   Vitality Shots\\nThese shots are milder than the wellness shots, sweet and spicy with an earthy aftertaste. Turmeric takes the spotlight here containing a compound called curcumin.   24 Bottles – 18 Juices (12oz), 6 Shots (2oz)   3 Greens with Ginger\\n3 Refreshing Citrus\\n3 Roots with Ginger\\n3 Sweet Citrus\\n3 Avocado Greens\\n3 Strawberry Orange Mango\\n3 Wellness Shots\\n3 Vitality Shots\\nMade with whole fruits and vegetables\\nNo sugars added\\nHigh-pressured processed (HPP)\\nKosher\\nIndividually labeled\\nKeep refrigerated\"],\n",

UNLIKE OTHER SPIN MOPS: NO foot pedal, NO plastic spinning axis, NO other unnecessary moving parts (wheels, agitator) to break or cause leaks. Mop head wrings 2X drier than foot pedal version. Sturdy, yet lightest bucket out of all spin mops makes it easier to fill and dump water. SELF-WRINGING MOP that easily spins dry with a gentle push on the handle. Hands stay dry, no bending, and cuts cleaning time in half. 55\" long handle. Swivel joint pivots 180° and rotates 360° to clean under furniture and along baseboards. It is also great for cleaning windows, walls, cars, and boats.

Machine washable reusable mop heads last 6-12 months saving hundreds of dollars in refill costs. Can also be used as dry mop to pick up hair and dust. INFORMATIVE VIDEOS help users get started quickly and demonstrate the key features that set Twist and Shout Mop apart.Have you tried traditional mops, spray mops or steam mops and gotten frustrated by how ineffective or overpriced they are? While the traditional mops are affordable, they do not clean well and are difficult to wring. Other mops seem to have you hooked on endless expenditures of proprietary pads and solution refills. And few of the mops can reach the dusty areas under furniture and tight corners.\\u200bTwist and Shout Mop is the original self-wringing mop that rotates at up to 2500 rpm. By gently pushing down the aluminum alloy handle, the mop spins dry automatically without touching. Unlike other spin mops, Twist and Shout Mop does NOT have the easily breakable foot petal. Its innovative design has won the gold medals of 2011 iENA International Innovation Award and 2011 INST International Invention Show.The super absorbent mop head is made of over 8,000 strands of microfiber that lock in dust, spills, and stains instead of pushing them around. Microfiber can absorb up to 8X their weight in liquid and cleans 3X better than cotton.The specially designed swivel joint allows the mop head to bend 180 degrees and easily clean the hardest reachable areas under furniture and around tight corners.And the best part of it all? This is a product that is designed for sustainability. It doesn’t require expensive disposable pad refills, special cleaning solutions, batteries, or power. You can clean with just water or any cleaning solution that is safe for your family and pets. Each microfiber mop head lasts up to a year and costs little to replace, minimizing your total cost of ownership compared to other cleaning systems in the market.Be Sure To View The Official Product Demo and Comparison Video Before Purchase'],\n",

       "  \"We were founded by one of Canada's most celebrated hockey stars, Tim Hortons. In 1964, Tim opened a coffee and donut shop in his neighborhood, setting out to create a place where anyone could go at any time and feel at home. A place where the door was always open for neighbors to pop by, where there was always a pot of coffee on (a fresh pot every 20 minutes to be exact). That single coffee shop became such a favorite that more locations soon began to open in neighborhoods across Canada, then the US, and now parts all over the world.   Tim Hortons Original hasn't changed in over 50 years, and is such a secret that only 3 people (and we're not telling who!) know the recipe. Our coffee team tastes more than 500 cups every single day to ensure that every cup tastes the same.

Spain is the second most mountainous European country after Switzerland, and so Serrano Ham is produced all over the country.When we talk about Serrano ham we do not refer to the general denomination of “cured ham from pigs raised in mountain areas” but, specifically, to a special ham category: which is one that comes from the white pig. The white pig is the result of the crossbreeding of Landrace, Duroc-Jersey, Large White and Blanco Belga, among others. These white pigs are fed with natural fodders, composed of cereals. Their young are controlled until the moment of the animal sacrifice, at the age of about 6 or 7 months, with an approximated weight of 95 to 100 kg.Spain has been producing cured hams for many centuries. Ham is a rooted product in the Spanish history and it can be considered as an essential factor of its culture.The Serrano Ham is produced according to traditional methods that award it a sweet and slightly aromatic palate. Its flavor and its sensory characteristics make it a gastronomic product of its highest quality, guaranteed by a traditional process and a good selection of raw material.Ingredients:Pork ham, sea salt.Storage Conditions:May be refrigerated. Store in a cool and dry place.Consumption:Ham should always be eaten at room temperature (57ºF at 71ºF).After carving, lay the slices on a wooden board and allow them to breathe for at least thirty minutes. This intensifies the flavour for a truly authentic taste. In Spain, Serrano Ham is usually eaten as a \"Tapa\". That is to say, as an aperitif, in small and very thin slices and perhaps accompanied with bread and a red glass of wine or a beer. But Serrano Ham, due to its excellent quality and gastronomically qualities, has inspired renowned chefs around the world to prepare all kinds of recipes (from the simplest to the most sophisticated).'],\n",

Imagine a American Wagyu burger on an artisanal brioche burger bun, topped with heritage-breed applewood-smoked bacon and crowned with creamy black truffle butter.   Every element of this burger is special, beginning with the beef: D’Artagnan American Wagyu beef comes from Wagyu cattle, the same breed that produces the famous Kobe beef of Japan. When raised in the United States, these cattle produce equally tender beef, but are referred to as “American Kobe-style” or simply “Wagyu.” The texture of this incredible beef carries a softness that defies description, along with that world-renowned buttery Kobe flavor.   American Wagyu beef offers buttery tenderness from pure Japanese Wagyu genetics, and robust beefy flavor from the small percentage of Certified Black Angus in the herd. It’s the best of both worlds, united in one tenderloin.   Just like the burgers, the bacon has impeccable credentials: heritage-breed hogs known for great taste and creamy fat are raised naturally on small family farms. The pork bellies are smoked over real applewood, and are cured without additives or nitrites. This slightly sweet bacon is the perfect topping for the burgers.   That would be enough for most, but to take this burger to the extreme, add D’Artagnan’s rich black truffle butter, with its pungent aroma, distinct flavor and aura of luxury for the ultimate burger topping.   What can you put these mega-burger ingredients on? Nothing but the best, artisanally-baked brioche buns will do. Not your standard burger bun, these buttery and springy brioche buns work perfectly with the other elements to create the ultimate fantasy burger. Your mouth will thank you.   Cooking tips:   Cook burger patties from frozen state to keep from overcooking them\\nCook to Desired doneness. We suggest cooking to an internal temperature of 160°f.\\nSlowly toast buns that have been smothered in truffle butter\\nPrepare bacon on grill over medium heat prior to cooking burgers, careful of flare-ups\\nTop off cooked burger with a large dollop of truffle butter'],\n",

D’Artagnan’s Ultimate Steak Lovers Gift Box is here to satisfy all the carnivores in your life!   American Wagyu Filet Mignon Steaks, 2 Steaks, 6 ounces each. American Wagyu beef offers buttery tenderness from Japanese Wagyu genetics, and robust beefy flavor from a small percentage of Certified Black Angus. It’s the best of both worlds, united in one steak.   American Wagyu Beef Patties, 2 Patties, 8 ounces each. Like the Wagyu beef filets, our burgers come from humanely raised cattle on small family ranches in the west. The Wagyu cattle live on pasture, never receive antibiotics or hormones and are finished in the traditional Japanese way: with incremental amounts of grain that encourage their natural propensity to exquisite and abundant marbling. 75% Lean, 25% Fat   USDA Choice Bone-In Ribeye Steaks, 2 Steaks, 20 -22 ounces each. These Choice-grade Angus steaks are wet-aged for 21 days to add complexity to the flavor. D’Artagnan’s group of dedicated ranchers raise Angus cattle on open pastureland, without antibiotics, hormones or any other artificial substances. All you get is clean beefy flavor – as it should be.   As if 3 amazing varieties of fantastic beef weren’t enough, this gift box also comes with gourmet accompaniments to help create the perfect steak dinner!   Black Truffle Butter is a silky creamery butter blended with real black truffles which adds a robust and earthy flavor to elevate steaks to the next level!   Veal Demi-Glace is made from a traditional recipe using veal bones, aromatic vegetables, water, wine and nothing else, and is slow-cooked for many hours, creating concentrated flavor and silky smooth texture. The perfect base for any sauce.   Dried Wild Mushroom Mix is packed with flavor and once reconstituted, makes a great topping on the steaks and burgers.   Whether a steak-searing pro or recipe-reading novice, this gift is perfect for lovers of all things beef and includes helpful tips and recipe ideas to keep the meals coming (hopefully back your way)!   Cooking tips:   Cook burger patties from frozen state to help ensure to prevent overcooking them\\nFilet mignon steaks & burgers are recommended cooked rare to medium-rare\\nSeason steaks simply with salt, pepper and olive oil and allow the extraordinary flavor to shine\\nMake a quick and easy pan sauce by adding the veal demi-glace in with the pan drippings once steaks are cooked. Scrape up any browned bits remaining in the pan while demi-glace is reducing. Cook until sauce is a syrupy consistency; stir in some truffle butter to finish. Season with salt and pepper if needed.\"],\n",

       "  'The chicken breast is the most popular cut for a reason. If you are among its many fans, you’ll rediscover its charms with D’Artagnan Certified-Humane Green Circle™ Chicken breast. This chicken is exclusively and humanely raised for D’Artagnan on small farms in the Amish community in free-range conditions without the use of any antibiotics or hormones. Old-fashioned methods are used to create a truly modern – and richly flavored – chicken. D’Artagnan’s Green Circle chicken program brings back the methods of family farms from over a century ago, when chickens lived on vegetable scraps and roamed freely around farmyards and pastureland. Inspired by that common-sense, waste-nothing philosophy, the chickens are raised on a diet of locally collected vegetables and trimmings. No growth hormones, tranquilizers, arsenicals or antibiotics are ever used. The chicken is also air-chilled during processing, which is vastly different from the industry standard in the U.S. where chickens are immersed in vats of cold water - which causes the chicken to absorb water and dilute the flavor, while also severely increasing the risk of cross-contamination. Air-chilled chicken is cooled by passing the birds through several chambers where cold, purified air is used to cool the meat - resulting in no added moisture, stronger flavor and less chance for contamination. The natural juices are not diluted, so the meat is more tender and flavorful. When you buy water-chilled chicken, you are paying for water—on average 8% of its body weight. But with air-chilling, all you pay for is chicken.Certified-humane chicken - No antibiotics or hormones addedRaised on small farms; diet is supplemented with locally collected vegetable scrapsAir-chilled for maximum flavor concentration24 breasts (2 breasts per pack; 12 packs per kit)12 packs, 11 lbs total minimum weightShips uncooked & frozen'],\n",

Imagine a American Wagyu burger on an artisanal brioche burger bun, topped with heritage-breed applewood-smoked bacon and crowned with creamy black truffle butter.   Every element of this burger is special, beginning with the beef: D’Artagnan American Wagyu beef comes from Wagyu cattle, the same breed that produces the famous Kobe beef of Japan. When raised in the United States, these cattle produce equally tender beef, but are referred to as “American Kobe-style” or simply “Wagyu.” The texture of this incredible beef carries a softness that defies description, along with that world-renowned buttery Kobe flavor.   American Wagyu beef offers buttery tenderness from pure Japanese Wagyu genetics, and robust beefy flavor from the small percentage of Certified Black Angus in the herd. It’s the best of both worlds, united in one tenderloin.   Just like the burgers, the bacon has impeccable credentials: heritage-breed hogs known for great taste and creamy fat are raised naturally on small family farms. The pork bellies are smoked over real applewood, and are cured without additives or nitrites. This slightly sweet bacon is the perfect topping for the burgers.   That would be enough for most, but to take this burger to the extreme, add D’Artagnan’s rich black truffle butter, with its pungent aroma, distinct flavor and aura of luxury for the ultimate burger topping.   What can you put these mega-burger ingredients on? Nothing but the best, artisanally-baked brioche buns will do. Not your standard burger bun, these buttery and springy brioche buns work perfectly with the other elements to create the ultimate fantasy burger. Your mouth will thank you.   Cooking tips:   Cook burger patties from frozen state to keep from overcooking them\\nCook to Desired doneness. We suggest cooking to an internal temperature of 160°f.\\nSlowly toast buns that have been smothered in truffle butter\\nPrepare bacon on grill over medium heat prior to cooking burgers, careful of flare-ups\\nTop off cooked burger with a large dollop of truffle butter'],\n",
